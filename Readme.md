Introduction
This documentation provides an overview and guide for using the PHP MVC (Model-View-Controller) Framework. This framework is designed to facilitate the development of web applications by following the MVC architectural pattern. It provides a modular and extensible structure for building robust and maintainable PHP applications.

Getting Started
To get started with the PHP MVC Framework, follow the steps below.

Requirements
Ensure that your system meets the following requirements before installing the PHP MVC Framework:

PHP 7.4 or later
Apache or Nginx web server
Composer
Installation
To install the PHP MVC Framework, perform the following steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/example/php-mvc-framework.git
Save to grepper
Change to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd php-mvc-framework
Save to grepper
Install the project dependencies using Composer:
bash
Copy code
composer install
Save to grepper
Configure your web server to point to the public directory of the framework.
Configuration
The configuration files for the PHP MVC Framework can be found in the config directory. Adjust the settings in these files according to your application's requirements.

Routing
The routing in the PHP MVC Framework is handled by the Router class. Routes can be defined in the routes.php file. Here's an example of how to define routes:

php
Copy code
use App\Controllers\HomeController;

$router->get('/', HomeController::class, 'index');
$router->get('/about', HomeController::class, 'about');
$router->post('/contact', HomeController::class, 'contact');
Save to grepper
Controllers
Controllers in the PHP MVC Framework handle the logic and data flow of your application. They interact with models to retrieve and manipulate data, and render views to display the final output. Controllers should be placed in the app/Controllers directory.

Models
Models represent the data and business logic of your application. They interact with the database and provide methods for data manipulation and retrieval. Models should be placed in the app/Models directory.

Views
Views in the PHP MVC Framework handle the presentation logic of your application. They are responsible for displaying data to the user. Views should be placed in the app/Views directory.

Middlewares
Middlewares in the PHP MVC Framework allow you to filter and modify HTTP requests and responses. They provide a convenient way to implement cross-cutting concerns, such as authentication, authorization, and input validation. Middlewares should be placed in the app/Middlewares directory.

Database
The PHP MVC Framework supports various database systems through the use of database drivers. The database configuration can be found in the config/database.php file. Use the appropriate database driver and configure the connection settings accordingly.

Authentication
Authentication in the PHP MVC Framework can be implemented using middleware or dedicated authentication libraries. You can define authentication routes, handle user registration and login, and manage user sessions.

Validation
Input validation is an important aspect of web application development. The PHP MVC Framework provides validation features that help ensure the integrity and security of user input. You can define validation rules for your form inputs and easily validate user-submitted data.

Error Handling
Error handling in the PHP MVC Framework is centralized in the ErrorHandler class. You can customize error handling and logging by modifying the app/Handlers/ErrorHandler.php file.

Testing
The PHP MVC Framework supports testing with PHPUnit. Test classes can be placed in the tests directory. Write test cases to cover your application's logic and functionality, and run the tests using the PHPUnit command.

Deployment
To deploy your PHP MVC Framework application, ensure that the server meets the framework's requirements. Configure the web server to point to the public directory of your application. Set the appropriate file permissions and ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed.

Contributing
Contributions to the PHP MVC Framework are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request on the project's GitHub repository.
